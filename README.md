This application includes:
* FuncX Web-Service
* Kuberentes endpoint
* Postgres database
* Redis Shared Data Structure

> :warning: **THIS IS A TEST DEPLOYMENT**: The web-service and forwarder can be deployed, while the funcx-endpoint is not yet properly supported

## Preliminaries
The following dependencies must be set up before you can deploy the helm chart:

## Kubernetes Endpoint
We can deploy the kubernetes endpoint as a pod as part of the chart. It
needs to have a valid copy of the funcx's `funcx_sdk_tokens.json` which can
be created by running on your local workstation and running
```shell script
 funcx-endpoint start
```

You will be prompted to follow the authorization link and paste the resulting
token into the console. Once you do that, funcx-endpoint will create a
`~/.funcx` directory and provide you with a token file.

The Kubernetes endpoint expects this file to be available as a Kubernetes
secret named `funcx-sdk-tokens`.

You can install this secret with:
```shell script
pushd ~/.funcx
kubectl create secret generic funcx-sdk-tokens --from-file=credentials/funcx_sdk_tokens.json
popd
```


> :warning: *Only for debugging*: You can set the forwarder curve server key manually by creating
  a public/secret curve pair, registering them with kubernetes as a secret and then specifying
  `forwarder.server_cert = true`. By default the forwarder auto generates keys, and distributes it
  to the endpoint during registration.

To manually setup the keys for debugging, here are the steps:

1. Create your cureve server public/secret keypair with the create_certs.py script:

    ```shell script
    # CD into the funcx-forwarder repo
    python3 test/create_certs.py -d .curve
    ```

2. Similar to the `funcx-sdk-tokens` add the public/secret pair as kubernetes secret:`funcx-forwarder-secrets` for the forwarder service.
```shell script
# Make sure the server.key_secret file is in your $PWD/.curve dir
kubectl create secret generic funcx-forwarder-secrets --from-file=.curve/server.key --from-file=.curve/server.key_secret
```

3. Once the endpoint is registered to the newly deployed `funcx-forwarder`, make sure to check the `~/.funcx/<ENDPOINT_NAME>/certificates/server.key` file to confirm that the manually added key has been returned to the endpoint.

### Forwarder
The forwarder needs to be able to open and manage arbitrary ports which is
not compatible with some of Kubernetes requirements. For now we will run it
as a docker container, but outside of the cluster.

Launch a copy of forwarder outside of kubernetes, listening on port 8080:
    ```shell script
     docker run --rm -it -p 8080:3031 funcx/forwarder:213_helm_chart
    ```

## How to Install FuncX
1. Make a clone of this repository
2. Download subcharts:
    ```shell script
     helm dependency update funcx
    ```
3. Create your own `values.yaml` inside the Git ignored directory `deployed_values/`
4. Obtain Globus Client ID and Secret. Paste them into your values.yaml as
    ```yaml
    webService:
      globusClient: <<your app client>>
      globusKey: <<your app secret>>
    ```
5. Install the helm chart:
    ```shell script
    helm install -f deployed_values/values.yaml funcx funcx
    ```
6. You can access your web service through the ingres or via a port forward
to the web service pod. Instructions are provided in the displayed notes.

7. You should be able to see the endpoint registering with the web service
in their respective logs, along with the forwarder log

## Database Setup
Until we migrate the webservice to use an ORM, we need to set the database
schema up using a SQL script. This is accomplished by an init-container that
is run prior to starting up the web service container. This setup image checks
to see if the tables are there. If not, it runs the setup script.

## Values

> :warning: **USE THE FOLLOWING dev_values.yaml**

``` yaml
webService:
  pullPolicy: Always
  host: http://localhost:5000

## Subcharts
This chart uses two subcharts to supply dependent services. You can update
settings for these by referenceing the subchart name and values from
their READMEs.

For example
``` yaml
postgresql.postgresqlUsername: funcx
```
